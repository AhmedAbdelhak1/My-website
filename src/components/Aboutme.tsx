            <h1>About me</h1>
            <p>I mainly aspire to enhance my programming knowledge and better my software development skills in the field of Computer Science. <br/> Such skills would open more opportunities for me in an industrial market that is increasingly requiring independent software developers and problem solvers. <br/>
            I am confident that the knowledge and skills I developed over the last five years as a recent MA graduate in Automatics and Industrial Computing  would help me to effectively solving complexe problems in the industry.for instance i am focusing about  learning web development "MERN stack",
            I am looking for junior fullstack developer position if you have any opportunity please contact me.</p>
